Im wondering if it makes sense to have the script run on one stock but will need to scrape huge amounts of data
to actually train it so this current project is working on one iteration in current time (not the trained model)
going to need to scrape alot of data for the training probably can still use the webscrapping script for this 




The model
-------------------------------------
going to start trying a decision tree forest model then maybe transistion to a decision tree forest
data transformations 


steps
------------------------------------
will likely train the model in colab and import it to vs code




thoughts
----------------
maybe make a new file that contains the stocks attributes bc this is how we could get the url of the stock
